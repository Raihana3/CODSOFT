# Task 3 - Credit Card Fraud Detection


This project uses machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns in transaction data.

##  Objective

To build classification models that can detect **fraudulent** vs **legitimate** credit card transactions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest

##  Dataset

  
   -fraudTrain.csv (from Kaggle)
  
   -fraudTest.csv

## Workflow

- Load and clean the dataset
- Handle missing values and convert date/time features
- Perform exploratory data analysis  to understand fraud patterns
- Address class imbalance 
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train classification models 
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score


##  How to Run

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raihana3/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT/Task3_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

2. Install Required Libraries
    Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Open Jupyter Notebook
   
    Then open the file: 'credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb
    
4. Run the Notebook
     Step through each cell to:

   - Explore and preprocess the data

   - Handle class imbalance

   - Train fraud detection models

   - Evaluate model performance and visualize metrics
