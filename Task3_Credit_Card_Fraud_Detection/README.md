# Task 3 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

---

This project uses machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions based on patterns in transaction data.

##  Objective

To build classification models that can detect **fraudulent** vs **legitimate** credit card transactions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest

##  Dataset

- Dataset: `creditcard.csv` (from Kaggle)
- Highly imbalanced (fraud cases are rare)

##  ML Concepts Applied

- Handling class imbalance
- Feature scaling
- Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest classifiers

## How to Run

1. Ensure `creditcard.csv` is in the same folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run
   ```bash
   python main.py
