# Task 2 - Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will **churn**  based on historical customer data and service usage.

## Objective

To identify customers likely to stop using a service using supervised machine learning.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest / Decision Tree

##  Dataset

- Dataset: 'churn_modelling.csv'
- Includes features like geography, age, credit score, balance, etc.

## Workflow

- Load and clean the dataset 
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Scale or normalize features 
- Train classification models 
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Interpret results


## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raihana3/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT/Task2_Customer_Churn_Prediction
   
2. Install Required Libraries

   Make sure the following Python packages are installed:
  
   ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Open Jupyter Notebook

   Then open the fie:' customer_churn_prediction.ipynb'

4. Run the Notebook

   Step through each cell to:

 - Load and explore the dataset

 - Preprocess and encode features

 - Train machine learning models 

 - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
